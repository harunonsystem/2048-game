# Project Overview

## Purpose
This is a 2048 puzzle game implemented in vanilla JavaScript. The game is a sliding number puzzle where players use arrow keys to move tiles on a 4x4 grid, combining tiles with the same numbers to reach the 2048 tile.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with grid-based game board
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with gradients, grid layout, flexbox, and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ class-based architecture
- **Local Storage**: For persisting best scores

## Architecture
The codebase follows a simple client-side only architecture:
- `index.html`: Main game interface with score display and game board
- `style.css`: All visual styling with modern CSS features
- `script.js`: Single Game2048 class containing all game logic

## Key Features
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
- Local storage for best score persistence
- Smooth animations and modern UI design
- Keyboard controls (arrow keys, WASD, R/Space for reset)
